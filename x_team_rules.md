# X-Team 55 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Everyone will express what they prefer to do, and if multiple people wish to do the same thing, we'll choose randomly. Whoever is furthest in their task will take any reassigned tasks.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Check what each member has comitted, and report progress by email.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will use the issues tab.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Communicate through email, and have a backup member assigned to each task.
